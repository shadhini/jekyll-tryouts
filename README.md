# Jekyll Experimentation Project

This project is set up as a sandbox to experiment with **Jekyll**, a popular static site generator. 

It serves as a playground for testing layouts, plugins, configurations, and other Jekyll features.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Learn and explore Jekyll's capabilities.
- Test features such as layouts, plugins, and asset management.
- Experiment with custom configurations, themes, and content generation.

## Features Being Tested

- **Dynamic Layouts**:
  - Separate layouts for authors, posts, and general pages are set up for easy experimentation.
- **Default Settings**:
  - Using the `defaults` section in `_config.yml` to assign layouts to specific content types.
- **Plugin Experimentation**:
  - Includes plugins like `jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-sitemap`, and `jekyll-seo-tag`.
- **GitHub Pages Compatibility**:
  - Configured to work seamlessly with GitHub Pages for deployment tests.
- **Asset Management**:
  - Testing custom CSS, JavaScript, and other assets structure.
