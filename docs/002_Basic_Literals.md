# Basic Literals

To use literals, you need to store them in variables; containers designed to hold a specific type of data.

Variables can only store matching data.

## Integer numbers
natural numbers; include zero and negative ones

```e.g: 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, -100```

```java
int numApples = 1000;
```

put the integer 1000 into a variable of an integer type, called `numApples`

You can increase code readability by dividing the digit into blocks with underscores: 

```java
int numPackedApples = 1_000_000;
```

## Characters
a single symbol; denoted with single quotes

```e.g: 'A', 'x', '0', '9', ' ', '$'```

```java
char charOne = '1';
int numOne = 1;
```

[**FUN FACT**] **characters sit between integers and strings**: they resemble strings, yet you can do math with them.

## Strings
a sequence of characters; encapsulated by double quotes
- a string can include letters, digits, whitespaces, and other characters altogether

```e.g.: "text", "I want to know Java", "123456", "e-mail@gmail.com"``` 

```java
char singleQuoted = 'A';
String doubleQuoted = "A";
```
