# Printing data

## Displaying text using println() and print()
* `Standard output` is a receiver to which a program can send information as text. 
* It is supported by all common operating systems. 
* Java provides a special `System.out` object to work with the standard output. 

### println  
displays the passed string followed by a new line on the screen (print-line). 
* allows you to print an empty line when no string is given:

### print  
displays the value that was passed in and places the cursor after it.



[**Tip**]

4 letters `sout` and pressing the `Tab` key in the IntelliJ IDEA  will automatically write `System.out.println()` 

## Printing numbers and characters
Both `println` and `print` methods allow a program to print not only strings and characters, but also numbers.
